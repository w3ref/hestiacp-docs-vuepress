### Step 1: Make sure that your server is running a supported operating system (amd64 or arm64):

- Debian 9
- Debian 10
- Debian 11
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Step 2: Log in as the system user (root):

You'll need to connect to your server as root, either directly from the console or remotely using SSH.

### Step 3: Download the installer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/release/install/hst-install.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the installer and follow the prompts:

```bash
bash hst-install.sh
```

### To perform an unattended installation (with defaults):

```bash
bash hst-install.sh --interactive no --email email@domain.tld --password p4ssw0rd --hostname hostname.domain.tld -f
```

### Or modify your installation with for exmaple:

```bash
bash hst-install.sh --apache no --postgresql yes --clamav no --spamassassin no
```

Will install Hestia without Apache2, ClamAV and Spamassassin How ever it will install Postgresql as additional feature.
