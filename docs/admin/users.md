With the introduction 1.4 we have added certain security features including the possibility to limit login from a certain ip address. When the ip address changes you will not able to login any more. To disable this feature via command line:

```bash
# Set value LOGIN_USE_IPLIST to "no"
v-change-user-config-value admin LOGIN_USE_IPLIST 'no'
# Remove listed ip addresses
v-change-user-config-value admin LOGIN_ALLOW_IPS ''
```

Now login as you are used to be.
