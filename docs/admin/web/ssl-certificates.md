## Error: Let's Encrypt validation status 400.

When requesting an SSL certificate the following error is often seen:

```
Error: Let's Encrypt validation status 400. Details: Unable to update challenge :: authorization must be pending means
```

It could mean multiple things:

1. Cloudflare proxy is enabled and SSL is set too strict.
1. Nginx / Apache2 is not reloading / Issue with an template
1. IPv6 is setup. Disable IPV6 in DNS
1. Wrong / Incorrect template.

In the future we hope to improve debugging but so far the easiest currently is:

Go to `/var/log/hestia/` and when you run the command you will multiple log files:

```
LE-{user}-{domain}.log
```

Open this log file an go to "Step 5"

You will see something like.

```bash
