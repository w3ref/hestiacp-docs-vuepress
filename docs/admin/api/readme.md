# Rest Api

The Hestia WEB API is available to perform core functions of the Control Panel. We use it internaly to synchronyze DNS clusters, to integrate WHMCS billing system The API can be used as well to create new user accounts, domains, databases or even to build an alternative web interface.

This reference provides php code samples demonstrating how you can seamlessly integrate API into your application or script. However you can use other languages to communicate with API.

## Examples

- [Create User Account](/admin/api/examples.html#create-user-account)
- [Create user (With API key)](/admin/api/examples.html#create-user-with-api-key)
- [Add Web/DNS/Mail Domain](/admin/api/examples.html#add-web-dns-mail-domain)
- [Create Database](/admin/api/examples.html#create-database)
- [List Web Domains](/admin/api/examples.html#list-web-domains)
- [Delete User Account](/admin/api/examples.html#delete-user-account)
- [Check Username and Password](/admin/api/examples.html#check-username-and-password)


## Unable to connect to the api

With the release of 1.4 Hestia has decided it was needed to tighten the security. If you connect from a remote server to the api. You are required to enter the ip address into the white. By default 127.0.0.1 is always allowed. If you need multiple ip addresses separate them with an enter.

## Can I disable the api

Disable the api via the settings. The file will be deleted from the server and all connections will get ignored. Please note some functions may not work without the api enabled.
